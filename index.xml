      <description>Formula 1 is an ultra competitive sport where the best and worst on the grid are mere seconds apart at their best. Every year the constructors work to built the best car possible and when it is ready, it is the drivers’ job to scrape every little bit of pace out of the car while not crashing. The line between control and disaster can be millimeters and the drivers need to be ready for anything.</description>

      <description>Besides goals, there are few things in soccer that change games quite like a red card. Late in an important match, the last thing that any manager wants is one of their players being sent off, reducing their team to ten men, or at least, that’s what common sense would say. However red cards do not automatically equate a loss and quite often teams manage to hang on to tie or even win while down a player.</description>
