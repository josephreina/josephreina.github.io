<p>Besides goals, there are few things in soccer that change games quite like a red card. Late in an important match, the last thing that any manager wants is one of their players being sent off, reducing their team to ten men, or at least, that’s what common sense would say. However red cards do not automatically equate a loss and quite often teams manage to hang on to tie or even win while down a player. So let’s take a look at just how costly red cards are, and are earlier red cards more detrimental than later red cards?</p>
